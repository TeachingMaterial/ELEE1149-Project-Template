## Structure of the Requirements Phase Report

You will need to produce a **markdown** documentation in the form of a report that details the requirements phase of the project.

- ensure that once the project is cloned to your local machine that you checkout to `'phase/2'` and branch off of this to your own branch using the following standard.. `'phase/2-gitusername'`. As part of your workflow, you will merge back into `'phase/2'` **ONLY**. 

- **Do not** merge to `main`.

Working as a team you will assign each other tasks to complete phase 2, refer to the required sections for the `README.md` file below.

The requirements phase `README.md` should include the following information:

- **Introduction** – specifying what diagrams are included in the report and what is their purpose. 
- **Table** - indicating the allocation of tasks to team members
- **Modelling** -  You will produce the following diagrams and place them in the report under suitable sub headings:
  - The overall architecture of the system;
  - Use Case diagrams including the tabular representation of the use cases;
  - Sequence diagrams;
  - Class diagrams;
  - Activity diagrams;
  - State chart diagrams.

- **References and Acknowledgements** – should contain the references you have used following the Harvard referencing system (http://www.citethisforme.com/harvard-referencing) and some acknowledgments thanking people / organisations who might have helped you preparing the report.

- **A Gantt chart of the project plan** – using [Mermaid Gantt Chart Template](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNpdUD1rwzAQ_SvHzTZYbiZtAdNOntKloOWwrqlILRXlPISQ_55TpRDaQ6DT--Chd8UleUaLR4oiLoKOBPlm2MNbgWAKdMy0VsqT8GvKKwnAh04_z_00Ve7Mi4QU4VDvCu5B6HyC51gyHYyD2fWD0dPBy-CbNCb54vw0WPoUfZMBKBb_N6bJK_hePCEWssU8IsxY3GZsbvofAhbGnccOV9ZvBa9VXIvUoepWdmh19ZRPDl28qY42SYdLXNBK3rjD7aeU0lp6gOyDpDzXan8bvt0BQFBqnQ) at the end of the README.md file under a section called Appendix to be included in the Appendix.
